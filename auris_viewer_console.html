            <h2>Problem statement</h2>
            <p>In early 2019, when Auris Health was still a startup company in Redwood City, they hired Triple Ring
                Technologies to help with the design and manufacturing of the viewer console of their clinical device,
                which was going to compete with the Da Vinci robot (shown in Figure 9).</p>

                <figcaption>Figure 9: Da Vinci Robotic Surgical System</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The Da Vinci Robotic Surgical System is an industry standard medical device made by Intuitive Surgical
                (also located in the Bay Area) which can perform a remote surgery. In other words, a doctor can stand on
                one side of the room with the robot on the other side (with a camera driving what they are seeing inside
                the patient). They then actuate various de facto surgical tools in front of them (for example, fake
                snippers and needles). Their hand motions trigger the robot performing the surgery on behalf of the
                doctors’ hand motions (via mirroring their actions), which has proven to be safer and cause fewer
                human-related errors.</p>
            <p>Auris assigned Triple Ring the viewer console portion of the device because it requires complicated
                opto-mechanical part design and tricky manufacturing steps that need to be developed. The idea behind
                the console is it takes a snake camera with two lenses that goes into the patient and projects an image
                back to the doctor. Through a series of mirrors and lenses, the doctor can see a 3D view of what is
                going on inside the patient, which helps with depth perception when they are using their surgical tools.
                Also, Auris was interested in gaining a competitive advantage over Intuitive Surgical and requested we
                do our homework to design a console that was lighter, smaller, and sleeker than the Da Vinci’s console.

            <h2>My role</h2>
            <p>This was the first project assigned to me at Triple Ring as a full-time employee. When I joined the
                project, we had used a contractor named Rob Campbell to design the most complicated optomechanical
                parts, ranging from optical housings with complicated machining operations and optical black anodizing
                finishing requirements. However, it was all designed as a CAD (SolidWorks) assembly; no parts had been
                ordered yet.</p>
            <p>The first steps were creating a manual bill of materials (BOM) of what Rob had designed into SolidWorks
                and a list of custom lens manufacturers and machine shops we’d be working with to deliver units (which
                ultimately ended up being 9 units in three iterations) to our client.</p>
            <p>We discovered early that the left and right optical housings, which drive almost all of the other parts
                we were ordering, were also going to be the trickiest to manage due to their complex machining
                operations (see Figure 10).</p>

            <figure>

                </div>
                <figcaption>Figure 10: Left housing (left), and right housing (right), with their lens stacks installed
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>We met in person with multiple machine shops to discuss the order of operations for machining these parts
                and for fit checking the lens stack manually before sending the parts for anodizing. These parts
                typically had an 8-week lead time once they were ordered. During the 8 weeks these parts were on order,
                we would use that time to develop what we call manufacturing process instructions (or an MPI), which
                explain how to put the unit together once you have ordered everything listed on the BOM to build one
                unit.</p>
            <p>The first time we write an MPI at Triple Ring, we usually have to use the SolidWorks CAD and rely on
                exploded views to explain how to put the unit together, as shown in Figure 11.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/image15.png" alt="Figure 11">
                <figcaption>Figure 11: Write MPI steps using CAD</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>This is why building the first unit (of any assembly at Triple Ring, but particularly early-stage
                prototypes) is so important. It gives the engineer the opportunity to replace CAD screenshots with
                real-life photos while also discovering assembly steps that need future improvements. On this project,
                my supervisor, Todd Harris used his professional Nikon camera. Todd has an optical background, which was
                why he was the overall Triple Ring technical lead for the project, and he co-wrote the MPI with me.</p>
            <p>We built one of each of the first two iterations of the console, Alpha and Beta. Eventually, we were
                contracted to build seven more design verification testing units, or DVT units, of which four were going
                to be sent off to a company in the UK called Surrey NanoSystems. Surrey NanoSystems specialized in an
                optical black coating called Vanta Black (see Figure 12), which absorbs 99.965% of light, an optical
                performance that was better than purely optical black anodized machined aluminum.</p>
            <p>Because we had built and iterated on the unit twice, by the time we were ready to order parts for DVT, we
                had already iterated on the overall design (parts, assembly, assembly sequence) twice to accommodate for
                design for manufacturing, design for assembly, cable management, electromagnetic interference (EMI)
                mitigation, thermal management, industrial design factors and human factors. With respect to the
                3D-printed parts that housed the machined aluminum, for example, there were industrial design
                requirements about how aesthetically pleasing it had to look (color and finish) while also accommodating
                the range of human head sizes, which feature different nose sizes and center-of-eye to center-of-eye
                distances.</p>

            <h2>Project outcome</h2>
            <p>When we created the contract for Auris for 7 DVT units, we wrote what was called a Statement of Work,
                which is what Triple Ring uses to define the scope, budget, and timeline of a given project.
                Unfortunately, around the time we were ready to order parts for these 7 units, COVID hit and Auris
                Health was acquired by Johnson & Johnson (J&J). Triple Ring did a good job managing the project
                throughout the early days of the pandemic. For example, Harris and I only came into the office (masks
                on) on days where we knew we needed to complete portions of the DVT build. Most of our other tasks
                (which revolved around the SolidWorks design and the respective documentation) could be performed
                remotely. Unfortunately, the transition from working with Auris directly to working with Auris under the
                J&J umbrella was not smooth.</p>
            <p>Not only did we need to interface with personnel from J&J that drove our weekly technical meeting with
                the client, but our J&J contacts had very little understanding of the technical challenges of this
                portion of the device or the Triple Ring and Auris design and device history records which drove much of
                the design intent and systems engineering up to that point in the project.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, while Triple Ring succeeded in delivering 7 DVT devices that were in specification of the
                required optical performance of the device (see Figure 13 for what the final unit looked like), Johnson
                & Johnson struggled to drive the project beyond that point, unable to integrate our console into a
                larger assembly context or to scale up and compete with the Da Vinci, which is already fully scaled up
                in production and has been the industry standard for 20+ years.</p>

                <figcaption>Figure 13: Final DVT Auris Viewer Console mounted to workbench</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>In fact, it was recently revealed publicly in court through a $1 billion dollar settlement with Auris
                that J&J blamed the missed milestone goals on technical problems with the Auris console while also
                arguing that they had the authority to use Auris' products in any way that advanced J&J's overall
                robotics program (something that became apparent to Triple Ring early on, which is why we chose not to
                pursue the next phase of this project despite the plan to build 9 more units).</p>
