                <h2>About Arik Singh</h2>
                <p>Arik Singh is a multidisciplinary designer and engineer driven by a passion for bridging the gap
                    between complex hardware systems and intuitive user experiences. With a diverse background spanning
                    medical devices, industrial design, and systems engineering, he thrives in environments that require
                    both technical precision and creative problem-solving. His approach is rooted in the belief that the
                    most effective solutions emerge from a deep understanding of both the engineering constraints and
                    the user's needs.</p>
                <p>His portfolio reflects a journey through various technical landscapes, from developing novel
                    acoustofluidic technologies to optimizing manufacturing processes with custom tracking systems. He
                    has hands-on experience in product design, having worked and specialized in medical device design
                    and engineering for a number of years, where reliability and usability are paramount. Whether
                    building mechatronic systems or streamlining IT procedures, Arik applies a rigor that ensures every
                    project is not just a concept, but a viable, efficient reality.</p>
                <p>Beyond the technical specifications, Arik is a maker at heart. He enjoys the challenge of taking an
                    abstract idea and refining it into a tangible product, constantly seeking new opportunities to apply
                    his skills in mechatronics and product development to create meaningful impact.</p>
