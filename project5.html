            <h2>Problem statement</h2>
            <p>Since bringing the Intra.Ox through FDA approval and into the marketplace, ViOptix has identified a user
                need from many of the clinics and doctors that they work with. Due to the different geometry involved in
                laparoscopic surgeries, clinicians were requesting that ViOptix develop a laparoscopic implementation of
                the Intra.Ox disposable/durable design (which would later be named the Lap.Ox). Similar to the Intra.Ox,
                this device features a disposable sheath enclosure and a durable (batteries are inserted into the
                durable this time instead of using a custom battery pack). However, various concessions in the design of
                the laparoscopic tube and optical polishing steps dictate that this device would have different core
                design and assembly process than the Intra.Ox.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>My role</h2>
            <p>At first, ViOptix and Triple Ring investigated a sterilization process that uses H2O2 (run by a company
                called Steris) that is available inside most hospitals and would render the need for a disposable
                enclosure obsolete. Unfortunately, through years of testing, it was discovered that this sterilization
                method has an adverse and unpredictable effect on the optics of our device and could not be considered a
                viable long-term solution for the Lap.Ox product.</p>
            <p>Instead, the disposable/durable concept remained crucial to the Lap.Ox design. We hypothesized internally
                that, in order to reach FDA 510k special approval on this device by the middle of 2025 (client
                expectation), Triple Ring would have to go through three iterations of the design quickly and order the
                last set of parts to arrive no later than June 2024.</p>
            <p>The first design was 3D-printed and assembled in house by me and my coworker, Jordan Sweer. The assembly
                was fully disposable and could only be used once (i.e., durable with N=1 uses). Jordan Sweer and I
                learned from this first assembly and through data collection to develop the second iteration of the
                design, which we called pre-design verification testing, or pre-DVT.</p>
            <p>In this phase of the project, my responsibility was part and assembly design. Due to the long lead time
                of injection molded plastics and printed circuit boards, the SolidWorks geometry had to be finalized,
                scrutinized, and ordered promptly to stay on schedule with the project. I was also responsible for doing
                the inventory tracking for both the durable and disposable parts, making sure we had enough parts to
                build 20 of each.</p>
            <p>Once again, Jordan Sweer and I assembled the devices (durables and disposables separately), writing a set
                of durable and disposable manufacturing process instructions (MPIs) in the process. While Jordan Sweer
                used these first 20 units for optical testing to establish thermal cycling parameters and optical
                corrections during device calibration, I worked on finalizing both MPIs. Eventually, due to the volume
                and technical difficulty of the durable and disposable assemblies, Triple Ring would have to pass on the
                assembly to contract manufacturers. A CAD representation of the durable and disposable are shown in
                Figure 17 and Figure 18.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>During the third iteration of the design, which we call the DVT units, we were responsible for building
                100 durables and 300 disposables for the client. Due to the optical nature of the disposable assembly,
                we contracted Molex (FiberGuide LLC) to build the 300 disposables. Because the durable assembly is less
                technically challenging, Triple Ring enlisted our local contract manufacturer (CM), Evolve, to build
                these 100 units.</p>
            <p>While I did bear the responsibility for updating the geometry for this third iteration as well as
                ordering enough parts to achieve our build quantities on time, my main job in this phase of the project
                was to act as the interface for both CMs. Because Jordan Sweer and I were the assembly experts, it was
                our responsibility to pass on any knowledge (including tips and tricks) that was not otherwise
                documented in our MPIs. It was also our responsibility to be available to debug assembly issues for
                either CM should they arise and help them hunt the issue to ground. Eventually, after the DVT builds are
                tested and submitted to the FDA for clearance, the client intends to scale up to 1000 durables a year
                and 10,000 disposables a year for production. In order to get to this phase of the product, Triple Ring
                needs to work with both contract manufacturers to offload the BOM and purchasing aspects of building
                these units for clients, including the management of a complex supply chain with many long lead time
                parts. In the world of contract manufacturing, this is called a “turnkey” product because the CM is able
                to buy parts and assemble units for our client in an entirely self-sufficient manner. Because I am the
                author of both the durable and disposable Lap.Ox BOMs, it will be my responsibility to manage the BOM
                handoff for the production phase.</p>

            <h2>Project outcome</h2>
            <p>Over the course of the last 18 months, we have hit every major milestone requested by the client, and in
                fact, sometimes were able to exceed expectations. In the pre-DVT phase of the project, Triple Ring was
                able to build a nicely polished unit for ViOptix’s CEO Scott Coleridge to show off at his board meeting
                for live StO2 oxygen measurements.</p>
            <p>In the current phase, due to the growing pains from switching the assembly operations from Triple Ring to
                Molex and Evolve, we are running slightly behind schedule procuring the 100 durables and 300
                disposables. That being said, of the durable and disposable units that we have received so far, we have
                performed optical, mechanical, electrical, software, and destructive testing on a large portion.
                Thankfully, all units thus far have performed within our defined systems engineering specifications for
                the Lap.Ox. As of November 1, 2024, we have 150 disposables that have passed calibration and testing and
                are ready for clinical use. Additionally, we have 60 durables that have passed calibration and testing
                and are also ready for clinical use.</p>
            <p>The DVT phase of this project has been successful in offloading the assembly cost and labor to both
                contract manufacturers. However, due to the time crunch of a fast-approaching FDA submission for this
                product, Triple Ring decided to calibrate the durables and disposables in-house with an established
                process. The intent is to further improve and tweak both calibration processes so that by the time we
                reach the production phase (ViOptix is asking for an output of 10,000 disposables and 1000 durables),
                the calibration process can be transferred over to both contract manufacturers. This would make it
                possible for both CMs to deliver turnkey products that are fully calibrated and ready for use in the
                field, in addition to being assembled and tested for power draw.</p>
