                <span><strong>Role:</strong> Researcher</span>
                <span><strong>Date:</strong> January – June 2015</span>
                <span><strong>Organization:</strong> UCSD (Professor James Friend)</span>

            <div class="project-content">
                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>I joined Professor Friend’s lab in 2017 after taking his class on advanced analytical methods for
                    solving non-linear ODEs. Professor Friend noticed a trend across his high-frequency vibration
                    experiments: the maximum particle velocity in a solid vibration wave never exceeded 1 meter per
                    second, regardless of frequency. We believed this to be a fundamental property of nature.</p>

                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>Professor Friend and I dug into the fundamental equations and discovered a theoretical velocity limit
                    for each material where it would experience cyclical yield stress and fail. We called this
                    "v<sub>max</sub>".</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="assets/images/image1.png" alt="Equation for Vmax">

                        and density.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>I used MATLAB to simulate tens of thousands of random material samples for 11 different materials
                    (metals, plastics, ceramics, etc.) using Monte Carlo analysis. We introduced imperfection factors
                    (Ψ) to model real-world flaws.</p>

                    <img src="assets/images/image2.png" alt="Psi imperfection factors">

                        v<sub>max</sub> and imperfection factors.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>We found that the likelihood of failure around the 1 m/s threshold was consistently high (around 50%
                    or greater) across all materials.</p>

                <h3>Project Outcome</h3>
                <p>My Monte Carlo model became the basis for a paper published in the Journal of the Acoustical Society
                    of America (JASA). After I graduated, the work was continued by Naiqing Zhang, and the project was a
                    resounding success.</p>

                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>Triple Ring was developing a handheld tissue oximeter called the "Intra.Ox" for ViOptix. The device
                    helps surgeons determine if tissue is oxygenated enough to survive post-surgery.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="assets/images/image6.png" alt="Intra.Ox Device">
                    <figcaption>Figure 4: T.Ox device details (Intra.Ox predecessor/context).</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The system consisted of a reusable "durable" unit and disposable components (battery pack and
                    sheath). The sheath needed to protect the durable from contamination in the operating room.</p>

                </figure>

                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>I was responsible for designing the custom O-ring for the disposable sheath. The challenge was to
                    create a seal that was soft enough to be closed by a nurse with less than 4 lbs of force, but
                    reliable enough to prevent leaks under low pressure differentials.</p>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>We modeled the seal design off a Pelican™ Case to create local compression points. I determined that
                    a 15 Shore A hardness was optimal. We worked with RD Rubber to develop a manufacturing process that
                    ensured the custom O-rings met our strict stiffness requirements (13-17 Shore A).</p>

                <h3>Project Outcome</h3>
                <p>The design passed FDA clearance. ViOptix now manufactures approximately 2,000 disposable sheaths
                    annually, and the device is used in hospitals across the country.</p>

                <p>Auris Health hired Triple Ring to help design and manufacture the viewer console for their robotic
                    surgical system, intended to compete with the Da Vinci robot. The goal was to create a lighter,
                    smaller, and sleeker console.</p>

                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>This was my first full-time project. I managed the Bill of Materials (BOM) and coordinated with
                    vendors for complex parts, including the optical housings which required precise machining and
                    anodizing.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>I co-wrote the Manufacturing Process Instructions (MPI) using CAD exploded views and later, real-life
                    photos from the first builds.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>We built multiple iterations (Alpha, Beta) and 7 Design Verification Testing (DVT) units. We utilized
                    Vantablack coating from Surrey NanoSystems to minimize light reflection within the console.</p>

                <h3>Project Outcome</h3>
                <p>We successfully delivered 7 DVT units that met optical specifications. However, following Auris
                    Health's acquisition by Johnson & Johnson, the project faced integration challenges and was
                    eventually deprioritized by the new parent company.</p>

                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>I integrated our PDM software (Windchill) with SolidWorks to manage metadata like vendor names and
                    costs. I interpreted and wrote scripts to parse SolidWorks assembly data into text files, which
                    could then be imported into formatted Excel templates.</p>

                <p>This allowed for automatic generation of indented BOMs and cost calculations (COGS).</p>

                <p>I designed the mechanical system in SolidWorks, featuring a three-layer acrylic chassis with
                    strategic component mounting and wire management. I also implemented the VIVE coordinate navigation
                    code, developing a "three-in-a-row" verification method to eliminate sensor noise and ensure
                    accurate positioning.</p>

                <h3>Project Outcome</h3>
                <p>The robot successfully completed manual and autonomous tasks, including wall-following and button
                    pressing. We achieved a grade of 46/50 on the project.</p>
