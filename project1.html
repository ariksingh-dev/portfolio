            <p><strong>Project:</strong> Independent study at UCSD, 2 quarters. Write a paper with Professor James
                Friend called “An investigation of maximum particle velocity as a universal invariant—Defined by a
                statistical measure of failure or plastic energy loss for acoustofluidics applications”</p>

            <h2>Problem statement</h2>
            <p>I first joined Professor Friend’s lab in 2017, right after I took his class on advanced analytical
                methods for solving non-linear ODEs using MATLAB. I was the only undergraduate in his lab, so there was
                a limited number of projects he could assign me due to my limited expertise.</p>
            <p>Over the years, Professor Friend noticed a trend across his experiments, which typically dealt with
                vibrations through robotics that happened at high frequencies. What he discovered was that if you solve
                for the maximum particle velocity inside a vibration wave in a solid (typically longitudinal but also
                can be transverse or shear waves), it never exceeds 1 meter per second regardless of the frequency of
                vibration. We believed this to be a fundamental property in nature, regardless of the material
                properties of the solid that is vibrating.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>My role</h2>
            <p>Professor Friend and I dug into some of the fundamental equations that might be driving this effect, and
                we discovered there is a theoretical velocity limit for each material in which it will experience
                cyclical yield stress and will inevitably “fail” and break. We called this theoretical limit “vmax”, as
                it was a unique material property that could be calculated as shown in Figure 1.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/image1.png" alt="Figure 1">
                <figcaption>Figure 1: Solving for vmax as a function of yield stress (σy), elastic modulus (E), and
                    density (ρ)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>To determine the range of vmax values in nature (in meters per second), we settled on 11 materials that
                range all over the spectrum of solids (metals, plastics, rubbers, etc.)—wood, diamond, copper, PVC,
                PMMA, steel, aluminum, polypropylene, concrete, glass, lithium niobate (a synthetic salt)— and
                calculated their vmax values. Unsurprisingly, most vmax values ranged from 0.1 to 10 meters per second,
                with diamond being at 100 meters per second due to its unique material properties (high yield stress
                relative to density and elastic modulus). However, we concluded that because vmax is an ideal
                interpretation of the velocity limit, real life material samples often have imperfections that can cause
                stress concentrations and induce crack propagation or material failure well before the particle velocity
                reaches vmax.</p>
            <p>To address the effects of these imperfections on each sample’s theoretical maximum particle velocity, we
                assigned factors in reducing maximum particle velocity (“psi” (Ψ)) and used Monte Carlo analysis to
                randomize their values based on potential cracks and imperfections in each material sample. The Ψ
                factors were based on the wave type (shear, transverse, longitudinal), frequency (real life effects of
                high frequency are not built into vmax model), flaws, ductile and brittle failure, and fatigue failure.
                We then solved for the velocity at which failure is guaranteed from the material-defined value vmax to a
                limiting particle velocity, vlim for the jth material sample (created about 10,000 samples per raw
                material). In other words, for a particular case defined by the type of acoustic wave and the shape of
                the structure that carries it, vlim (not vmax) defines the threshold between material integrity and
                failure. The Ψ equations are shown in Figure 2.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Using MATLAB, I simulated tens of thousands of random material “samples” for the 11 materials we had
                chosen as a baseline for our Monte Carlo model.</p>
            <p>Each individual sample (sample j) of material X was assigned a vlim value that was based on the
                material’s vmax and the jth sample’s Ψ1 - Ψ5 values.</p>
            <p>What we found across the board was the likelihood in a random sample of any material, including diamond,
                was around 50% or greater around 1 m/s threshold in all 11 materials (within 1 order of magnitude).
                What’s interesting about diamond is that despite its high theoretical vmax limit, the effects of
                imperfections and stress concentrations were stronger on diamond that any other material on our list,
                which is why the likelihood of failure in diamond is still 50% at 3 m/s as shown in Figure 3.</p>

            <h2>Project outcome</h2>
            <p>Since I was only able to work on this project for two quarters with Professor Friend, I was only able to
                establish the main Monte Carlo model that would later be used to solve for the probability of 50%
                failure of each of the 11 materials we had selected. When I graduated, I handed off my MATLAB model to
                Professor Friend’s graduate student, Naiqing Zhang.</p>
            <p>Naiqing spent the next year working with Professor Friend on the graphs, presentation, and structure of
                the paper. He also added a section about the immediate relevance of our discovery in the world of
                acoustofluidics and helped Professor Friend with the theoretical derivation in the appendix.</p>
            <p>About two years after I graduated, Professor Friend called me to congratulate me on the work I did years
                earlier to get this paper published. Professor Friend and Naiqing were able to leverage their
                acoustofluidics contacts at the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (JASA) to get the paper
                published the project was a resounding success.</p>
